# Kindall's SQL Portfolio

## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! 

This code repository contains examples of SQL code that I've written for my coursework at Western Governors University and various Data Analytics courses that I have taken during my self-learning.

I have experience with SQL in PostgreSQL (pgAdmin4), MySQL and SQLiteStudio. 

The concepts and queries demostrated through my portfolio here range from beginner to advanced, including a project that dives deeply into answering a hypothetical business question.
